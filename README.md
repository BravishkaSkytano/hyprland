# Hyprland

This repo contains all the config files for my hyprland setup on VoidLinux.
I've also included an install script and an update script for future reference.
Please be sure to check out [Makrennel's hyprland void-src repo](https://github.com/Makrennel/hyprland-void) for more info
and refer to to [Jake@Linux](https://youtu.be/-tCdeY1Jqk0?si=w4CPaMrdaL6qeXDG) for the full install tutorial

Both scripts must be run with sudo privileges.
